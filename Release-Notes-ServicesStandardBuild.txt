Release: SSB v3 GA
Released: 28 February 2017

****************************************
OVERVIEW OF RELEASE
****************************************

Version 3 of the Services Standard Build (SSB) contains several new 
features and fixes.

****************************************
NEW TO THIS RELEASE:
****************************************

 - A new 'document' target automates creation of documentation of common IdentityIQ
   object types, providing a Javadoc-style collection of HTML documents.  See the User
   Guide for more information.
 - Ability to detect loggers defined in BeanShell code and custom Java source code and
   add them as lines in log4j.properties (but commented out), avoiding the need to look
   up the name of the logger in the code when debugging.  See the User Guide for more
   information.
 - Updates to SSB User Guide


Bugs fixed since SSB v2 GA

 - Build was failing if there were two tokens on the same line
 - Multi-line tokens were not working
 - Token validation failed when directory path had spaces
 - Build was failing if target.properties was empty
 - Missing tokens write back to target.properties was removing token on first line
 - Importdynamic console_user and console_pass must now be lower case as previously 
   documented
 - Modified names of example custom SSB scripts so that they do not execute by default
 - SSB now correctly handles environment-specific build.properties files
 - Files under the SSB config folder with uppercase .XML were being excluded from token 
   replacement and the sp.init-custom.xml file
 - The SSB importdynamic target was not ignoring files in the ignorefiles.properties
